# StreamChatableProject
Since Pok√©mon Twitch Chat, I always dreamed to make a Twitch chat game type. Stream Chatable project is the crossover with "Can it blend" . We want to try if we can "Twitch chat" the game when we know it is a bad idea just to have fun to see if it is possible.

(I like Twitch but I would love to have a multiplatform battle and coop system.
Where every player is a stream platform when needed or possible.)
